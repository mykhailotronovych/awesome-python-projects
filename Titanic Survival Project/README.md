# Titanic Survival Project

 For this beginnerâ€™s project, we will use the Titanic dataset that contains real data of the survivors and people who died in the Titanic ship.

# Problem Description-
This project highlights my approach to the introductory machine learning competition on Kaggle website- Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

# Using:
* google colab
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn




## Workflow stages

1. Question or problem definition.
2. Acquire training and testing data.
3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
5. Model, predict and solve the problem.
6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
7. Supply or submit the results.

#On this project are testing a multiple regrassion model there example are below
1. Logistic Regression
2. KNN or k-Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machines
4. Naive Bayes classifier
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forrest
