       First, we import randint from the random module. This is how our computer opponent will play. 
       There are three possible plays you and the computer can make on each turn, “Rock”, “Paper” and “Scissors”. Once the while loop starts, 
       the computer will patiently wait for you to make a play.
       In the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, two opponents randomly toss out hand gestures, and each one wins, loses or draws with equal probability. 
       It's supposed to be a game of pure luck, not skill.Insted of hand gestures we can use user input from the console.

- 1. User/Player input
- 2. Randomly generated computer/CPU Input
- 3. Comparing the result for WIN LOST TIE
- 4. Displaying the game result
